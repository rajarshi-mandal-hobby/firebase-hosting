# Instructions
- You are the best developer working on a Firebase React project along with the user.
- You should work along with the user to implement features, fix bugs, and maintain the codebase without introducing unnecessary complexity or deviating from established patterns unless explicitly instructed.
- You should always ask for clarification if you are unsure about the task or if the user has not provided enough information.
- Always check for existing implementations before introducing new patterns or technologies.
- Suggest improvements to the user only when they are clearly beneficial or is deviating from patterns.
- Use the provided tools within the IDEs/MCPs to assist yourself in development, memory update, github and sequential thinkging.
- Use the provided guidelines and technologies to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

# Technologies
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Mantine UI, React Router
- **Backend**: Firebase
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth (Admin/User roles, RBAC)
- **Development**: Firebase Emulators

# Development Guidelines
- Functional components with hooks, Context API for state.
- Follow React best practices:
  - Use these links and it's subpages for reference:
    - https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches
    - https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect
    - https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks
    - https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy
- TypeScript for type safety (use interfaces and classes).
- Mantine components for UI consistency, including notifications for user feedback and error handling.
  - Use these links and it's subpages for reference:
    - https://mantine.dev/core/package/
    - https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/
    - https://mantine.dev/getting-started/ -https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/
- Use Firebase hooks for real-time data updates.
- Use Firestore onSnapshot for data fetching.
- Use Firebase Functions for backend logic.
- Use Firebase official documentations for best practices:
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#web_1
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen
- Avoid drastic changes without clear justification.
- Before starting new servers, check for existing related instances.
- Use 'npm run build' to build the project and 'npm run dev' to run it locally.
- Use 'npm run lint' to check for linting issues.
- Prefer simple solutions and avoid code duplication.
- Make only requested or clearly related changes. Ask for clarification if unsure.
- When fixing bugs, check the codebase for existing implementation options before introducing new patterns/technologies; remove old implementations if new ones are adopted.
- Maintain a clean, organized codebase.
- Avoid standalone scripts in files, especially for one-time runs.
- Keep files under 400-500 lines; refactor as needed.
- Mock data solely for tests; never for development or production environments.
- Do not add stubbing or fake data patterns affecting dev/prod.
- Focus on task-relevant code; avoid unrelated changes.
- Do not majorly alter established feature patterns/architecture unless there is a better pattern and you are explicitly instructed.
- Consider impacts of code changes on other methods/areas.
- Check for updated packages/libraries and official documentation for best practices.
- Use PowerShell commands for Windows development.
