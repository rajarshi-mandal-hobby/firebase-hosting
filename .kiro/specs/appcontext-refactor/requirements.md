# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the AppContext architecture to improve code maintainability,
reduce duplication, and enhance developer experience. The current implementation has grown to over 1470 lines across
AppContext.tsx (~770 lines) and firestoreService.ts (~700+ lines) with significant duplication of real-time subscription
logic and mixed responsibilities. The refactoring will implement a context-centric architecture with custom hooks,
reducing the total codebase by approximately 37% while maintaining all existing functionality and improving code
organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Organization and Size Reduction

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the AppContext and service layer to be properly organized with clear
separation of concerns, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the codebase without navigating through
overly large files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the total lines of code SHALL be reduced from ~1470 lines to ~920 lines (37%
   reduction)
2. WHEN examining the AppContext file THEN it SHALL contain no more than 350 lines focused solely on real-time state
   management
3. WHEN examining the service layer THEN it SHALL be simplified to a ~20 line export file with individual service
   modules
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no duplicate onSnapshot subscription logic between files
5. WHEN analyzing file responsibilities THEN each file SHALL have a single, clearly defined purpose

### Requirement 2: Real-time Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want all existing real-time functionality to be preserved
during the refactoring, so that users continue to see automatic UI updates when data changes in Firestore.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member is added, edited, or deactivated THEN all components displaying member data SHALL update automatically
   without manual refresh
2. WHEN a payment or ad-hoc expenses are recorded THEN member balances and total outstanding amounts SHALL update in
   real-time across all UI sections
3. WHEN bills are generated THEN all active member data SHALL update simultaneously across the application
4. WHEN member data changes THEN the member dashboard SHALL reflect updates immediately for logged-in members
5. WHEN upiVpa is modified THEN all components using payment settings SHALL update automatically
6. WHEN activeMemberCounts change THEN member statistics displays SHALL update in real-time across admin interface
7. WHEN a member's optedForWifi status changes THEN WiFi member counts and billing calculations SHALL update
   automatically
8. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN real-time subscriptions SHALL reconnect automatically with proper error
   recovery
9. WHEN admin operations complete THEN member dashboard users SHALL see updates immediately without requiring page
   refresh
10. WHEN member account linking occurs THEN member dashboard access SHALL be granted immediately with real-time data
11. WHEN any member's outstandingBalance changes THEN the total outstanding amount display SHALL recalculate and update
    automatically across all admin interface sections

### Requirement 3: Custom Hooks Architecture

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want business logic extracted into reusable custom hooks following React best
practices, so that I can easily test, maintain, and reuse operation logic across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing member operations THEN there SHALL be a useMemberOperations hook containing all CRUD operations
2. WHEN implementing billing operations THEN there SHALL be a useBillingOperations hook containing payment and bill
   generation logic
3. WHEN implementing admin operations THEN there SHALL be a useAdminOperations hook containing admin management
   functionality
4. WHEN implementing member dashboard operations THEN there SHALL be a useMemberDashboard hook containing
   member-specific functionality
5. WHEN implementing authentication operations THEN there SHALL be a useAuth hook containing account linking logic
6. WHEN implementing payment settings THEN there SHALL be a usePaymentSettings hook for fetch-when-needed UPI settings
7. WHEN using any custom hook THEN it SHALL follow React patterns guidelines with proper error handling and loading
   states

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Simplification

**User Story:** As a developer working with data operations, I want a simplified service layer with clear exports and no
over-aggregation, so that I can easily import and use specific services without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing services THEN there SHALL be direct exports of individual service modules only
2. WHEN examining the main service file THEN it SHALL contain no more than 20 lines of simple exports
3. WHEN looking for real-time logic THEN it SHALL exist only in AppContext, not in service files
4. WHEN accessing utility functions THEN they SHALL be exported directly without wrapper classes
5. WHEN using services THEN there SHALL be no large aggregation objects or unnecessary abstraction layers

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a developer implementing user-facing features, I want comprehensive error handling with user-friendly
messages and recovery mechanisms, so that users have a smooth experience even when errors occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
2. WHEN Firestore operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error handling based on error codes
3. WHEN form submissions fail THEN the system SHALL highlight specific fields and show actionable error messages
4. WHEN connection issues arise THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry with visual feedback
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show clear success notifications with specific action confirmation
6. WHEN offline state is detected THEN the system SHALL show appropriate indicators and auto-retry when connection
   returns

### Requirement 6: Developer Experience and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project or maintaining existing code, I want clear code organization with
proper TypeScript types and documentation, so that I can quickly understand and work with the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any custom hook THEN it SHALL have clear TypeScript interfaces for all parameters and return values
2. WHEN reviewing file organization THEN the structure SHALL follow the defined architecture with hooks in
   src/contexts/hooks/
3. WHEN reading code THEN each function and hook SHALL have clear, descriptive names indicating their purpose
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN all components and hooks SHALL have proper displayName properties
5. WHEN working with the codebase THEN there SHALL be no breaking changes to existing component interfaces
6. WHEN adding new features THEN the architecture SHALL support easy extension without modifying core files

### Requirement 7: Performance and React Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing application performance, I want the refactored code to follow React best
practices and maintain or improve current performance characteristics, so that the application remains responsive and
efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing hooks THEN they SHALL follow React patterns guidelines for proper hook usage
2. WHEN managing state THEN complex state SHALL use useReducer and simple state SHALL use useState appropriately
3. WHEN creating event handlers THEN they SHALL be memoized with useCallback when passed to child components
4. WHEN performing expensive calculations THEN they SHALL be memoized with useMemo with proper dependencies
5. WHEN subscribing to real-time data THEN subscriptions SHALL have proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN components re-render THEN there SHALL be no unnecessary re-renders due to unstable dependencies

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want the refactored architecture to be easily testable with
clear separation of concerns, so that I can write comprehensive tests and maintain high code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing custom hooks THEN they SHALL be independently testable without complex setup
