# Member Dashboard - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Member Dashboard feature provides a comprehensive self-service portal for rent management application members. This feature enables members to view their personal rent information, payment history, make UPI payments, and interact with the community through a friends directory. The system integrates with Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization, AppContext for state management, and includes a complete service layer architecture with proper folder structure organization.
